# OSS Lab 4 Part 7 - Project idea

## Project Description

Our project would supply end-to-end encrypted services such as calendar, contacts, email, and file storage. This service would be secure by default and the open source codebase would allow security experts to verify code quality and ensure there is no tracking/spyware. Additionally, companies could host their own servers to ensure they own their data, however for smaller companies we provide the option to host for a monthly fee.

## Project Business Model

The business model for our project would be selling professional services to the client. This would include training, technical support, and consulting about the product. This is the model used by several large companies like RedHat and IBM.

## License

We chose to use the MIT License for our project. This permissive license aligns with our business model of providing a service to the customers, and thus we do not care if other individuals use and redistribute our product.
